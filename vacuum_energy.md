# Vacuum Energy Simulation

This script simulates the vacuum energy field and the potential for virtual particle pair creation in a cubic meter of space. It uses quantum field theory concepts to model the fluctuations and interactions of virtual particles.

## Features

- Random creation and annihilation of virtual particle pairs
- Calculation of vacuum energy based on zero-point energy of particles
- Display of particle counts, total energy, and average energy over time
- Tracking of total interactions between particles

## Usage

To run the simulation, simply execute the script using Python 3:

```
python vacuum_energy.py
```

The simulation will be displayed in the terminal using curses. Press `Ctrl + C` to exit.

## Script Overview

- `vacuum_energy.py`: Main script file containing the simulation logic.
- `simulate_vacuum_energy()`: Function to simulate the vacuum energy field and update particle counts and energy.
- `display_vacuum_simulation()`: Function to display the simulation using curses.
- `zero_point_energy()`: Function to calculate the zero-point energy of particles.
- Particle types and masses are defined in the script.
- The script uses a global dictionary to store particle counts and other simulation data.
- Time steps are incremented to track the progression of the simulation.

## Dependencies

- Python 3
- numpy
- curses

## Limitations and Future Improvements

- Simplified model: The simulation does not include all known particles and interactions, and it makes several assumptions for simplicity.
- Lack of visualization: While the simulation is displayed in the terminal, a graphical representation would provide a clearer understanding.
- Real-time scaling: Currently, the script does not scale the simulation to real-world units or time frames.
- Experimental validation: Comparison with experimental data or theoretical predictions is not implemented yet.

## Contributions

Contributions and feedback are welcome! Feel free to submit issues or pull requests to improve the script.
